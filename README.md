# Simple-Parallax
This is the code for Parallax.js a great way to enhance the elegancy of your Websites...
This actually uses the princliple of Mouse Ref and roatates and hovers the images as per your MOUSE....
Some Pointers to note:
1. SAVE all the file in the SAME-FOLDER rather it be your DESKTOP or a "PARALLAX" folder...BUT it should be the SAME...
2. If you wanna change the image just ownload and SAVE in the same FOLDER and also remember to chnage that CERTAIN and SAME name in the .html FILE to eradicate any further ISSUES...
